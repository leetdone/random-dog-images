# random-dog-images
Dogs are cute! 
In this simple app, users can get random images of a specific breed. The type of breed is chosen by a pick view.
All the images are gotten from https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/
To enjoy dog images, just download, and open the project in xcode. The app should run well in simulator.
